# Why version Control?


## Why?
- Easy way to fix mistakes
- Protection from human error
- Tracking of every individual change and prevent work from conflicting



# Git vs Github


## Git: What is it?
- The most widely used version control system
- Git takes snapshots
    - Taking a picture of what your files look like at that given time


## Git: What makes it unique?
